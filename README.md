Overview:
This project is a simple implementation of a word-guessing game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The game selects a word at random from a predefined list, and the player must guess the letters of the word within a limited number of attempts. The project demonstrates the use of classes, methods, and encapsulation.

Features:
Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
Allows the player to guess letters of the word.
Keeps track of the guessed letters and remaining attempts.
Displays the current state of the word with correct guesses and underscores for remaining letters.
Notifies the player of win/lose status.
